## RAltGo

##### Server-side alt:V API for Go (Developed based on [altv-rust]([xxshady/altv-rust: Server-side alt:V API for Rust. Client-side via JS WASM WIP (github.com)](https://github.com/xxshady/altv-rust)))

#### **This module has reduced the performance overhead caused by CGO, allowing you to get closer to docking Go performance**

###### Thanks to the contributors of the altv-rust module for allowing me to make this Go module in Rust

###### 

**It is still under development and is not recommended for use in any production environment at the moment.**

<strong>But you can try to use it and raise a related issue if you encounter problems</strong>


<font color="red">Note: Because it is developed based on altv-rust, the problems that occur in altv-rust may also occur in this module!</font>
